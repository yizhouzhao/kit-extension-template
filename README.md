Gear analysis is fun but hard. Without getting connect to good physics, the gear simulation cannot be performed accurately. We provide this extension `Gear Simulator` in Omniverse to support customized gear with customized analysis.

# Get started with Omniverse Code/Create [version >= 2022]

## Download the [release](https://github.com/yizhouzhao/GearSimulator/releases/tag/0.2) or clone the this repository 

```
git clone https://github.com/yizhouzhao/GearSimulator
```

Upzip or locate the root folder as <your-path-to-GearSimulator>

The file structure of this extension should look like:

```
<your-path-to-GearSimulator>
    └───exts    [Omniverse extenstion]
         └───your.app.template
                └───config  [Extension config]
                └───icons   [Extension icons]

# Play with Gear Simulator

## 1. Create Gear

Set up gear properties and Click `Create Gear`

![create](img/create_gear.png)

We support live editting gear features.

## 2. Add physics

Right now, the gear is just a mesh with any collision or rigid body. 

Click `Add Physics` to add rigid body, and D6 joint to the gear. The D6 joint allows it to rotate on z-axis.

## 3. Add Driver

To make the gear rotate by itself, we can click `Add Driver` with a specific speed.

# Additional features

## Bind two gear

Two simulate two gears rotate on the same axis, select two gears and 

click `Bind Gear` to add a fixed joint between them.
